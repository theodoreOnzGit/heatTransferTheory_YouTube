abstract = {Under standard operating conditions, the emissivity of structural alloys used for various components of nuclear reactors may evolve, affecting the heat transfer of the systems. In this study, mid-infrared emissivities of several reactor structural alloys were measured before and after exposure to environments relevant to next-generation reactors. We evaluated nickel-based alloys Haynes 230 and Inconel 617 exposed to helium gas at 1000 °C, nickel-based Hastelloy N and iron-based 316 stainless steel exposed to molten salts at 750–850 °C, 316 stainless steel exposed to liquid sodium at 650 °C, and 316 stainless steel and Haynes 230 exposed to supercritical CO2 at 650 °C. Emissivity was measured via emissive and reflective techniques using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Large increases in emissivity are observed for alloys exposed to oxidizing environments, while only minor differences were observed in other exposure conditions.},

abstract = {AbstractLiquid fluoride salts and helium have desirable properties for use as working fluids for high-temperature (500 to 1000°C) heat transport in fission and fusion applications. This paper presents recent progress in the design and analysis of scaled thermal-hydraulic experiments for fluid mechanics and convective heat transfer in liquid salt and helium systems. It presents a category of heat transfer fluids and a category of light mineral oils that can be used for scaled experiments simulating convective heat transfer in liquid salts. By optimally selecting the length, velocity, average temperature, and temperature difference scales of the experiment, it is possible to simultaneously match the Reynolds, Froude, Prandtl, and Grashof numbers in geometrically scaled experiments operating at low-temperature, reduced length, and velocity scales. Mechanical pumping power and heat input are reduced to {\~{}}1 to 2{\%} of the prototype power inputs. Helium fluid mechanics and heat transfer likewise can be simulated by nitrogen following the same procedure. The resulting length, velocity, temperature, and power scales for simulating helium are quite similar to those for the liquid salts, and the pressure scale is reduced greatly compared to the prototypical pressure scale. Steady state and transient heat transfer to a steel and graphite structure can be reproduced with moderate distortion using Pyrex and high-thermal-conductivity epoxies, respectively. Thermal radiation heat transfer cannot be reproduced, so the use of these simulant fluids is limited to those cases where radiation heat transport is small compared to convective heat transport, or where corrections for thermal radiation heat transfer can be introduced in models using convective heat transfer data from the simulant fluids. Likewise for helium flows, compressibility effects are not reproduced.},

abstract = {Molten salts consisting of 60{\%} sodium nitrate and 40{\%} potassium nitrate have been used successfully as a thermal energy collection and storage fluid in different solar thermal plants. However, the relatively high melting point of this mixture (221°C) represents an important risk of local solidification in the operation of the solar power plants during standby periods. In this work, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to analyze the cooling process of representative state-of-the-art molten salt thermal storage tanks during these standby periods. A comprehensive set of operating conditions is analyzed, covering both hot and cold storage tanks, charging levels, and heat losses. Results show that the onset of local crystallization is highly influenced by the tank charging level. While the risk is relatively high in the case of the minimum charging level, in the case of maximum charging level the risk is minimal as it would require a very long standby period. To summarize the results, this work presents a safe charging level calculation, as a function of the operation temperature and the expected standby duration, which could be used as part of an appropriate operational strategy to avoid the risk of freezing for long standby periods. The model assumptions, the different configurations studied and their results are presented and discussed in detail.},

abstract = {A new experimental platform was built to measure the flow and heat transfer characteristics of molten salt in some large-scale heat exchangers. Based on this experimental platform, the turbulent heat transfer characteristics of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger designed for molten salt were investigated. The tube-side and shell-side Reynolds number vary from 10,000 to 91,000, and from 11,000 to 27,000, respectively. The heat transfer characteristics of water in the same heat exchanger were also measured to confirm the accuracy and usable range of experimental results. The results showed that the deviation of tested convective heat transfer coefficients between molten salt and water is just 14.1{\%} which is comparable to the experimental uncertainty of 12.8{\%}. Therefore, in view of decreasing the difficulty and cost of experiment, water is suggested to replace molten salt for measuring the heat transfer characteristics of molten salt heat exchanger. In addition, some empirical correlations for heat transfer characteristics in both sides of heat exchanger were obtained. The tube-side correlations agree well with the typical Dittus-Boelter correlation with an allowable difference of 10{\%}. The difference between shell-side correlation and the Dittus-Boelter correlation is also less than 20{\%} when the proper hydraulic diameter is selected as the characteristic dimension.},

abstract = {AbstractInterest in molten salts for next-generation nuclear reactors has led to increasing design work over the last several years. Much of this builds off historic heat transfer experiments like those of the Molten Salt Reactor Program; however, there is no comprehensive report covering experimental heat transfer in these fluids. This paper attempts to pull together all available reports on fluoride salt heat transfer to aid further research in this area. The data largely support the hypothesis that molten salt heat transfer will be easy to predict so long as salt properties are well known. This paper does not show any consistent indications of resistive films, entrained gases, or radiation heat transfer, but other unknowns are present. In addition to salt properties, these include unusual mass transfer and transition flow conditions.},

abstract = {This paper investigated the heat transfer performance of molten salt steam generator used in the solar power tower plant and testified the validity of the well-known classical heat transfer correlations and four new convective heat transfer correlations. Various experiments on the heat transfer performance of molten salt with high pressure water/steam in a horizontal tube-in-tube have been carried out on the test-bed under the inlet molten salt temperature of 400 °C/450 °C/500 °C and the inlet water/steam temperature of 300 °C/390 °C, respectively. The experimental results showed that the range of the Nusselt numbers of molten salt is 40–70, and the inlet molten salt temperature played an important role in heat transfer of molten salt and water/steam. However, the effect of the pressure of water/steam was slight. In addition, based on the experimental data, good agreement was observed between the experimental data of molten salt and part of classical and new correlations. Finally, the fitted forced convective heat transfer correlations of molten salt were obtained by using multiple linear regressions within a deviation of ±10{\%}.},

This paper discusses the system and several operating conditions spanning a wide range of behavior to aid the development of other systems, simulation benchmarks, or system-codes. Analysis of heat transport phenomena indicates that standard Nusselt number correlations apply to a first approximation. More accurate salt-freezing models may be necessary for air-cooled salt-systems due to the insulating affect of the low thermal-conductivity frozen salt layer on the cold pipe walls.},

abstract = {The need for high-temperature (greater than 600°C) energy transport systems is significantly increasing as the world strives to improve energy efficiency and develop alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Liquid fluoride salts are one of the few energy transport fluids that have the capability of operating at high temperatures in combination with low system pressures. The fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor design uses fluoride salt to remove core heat and interface with a power conversion system. Although a significant amount of experimentation has been performed with these salts, specific aspects of this reactor concept will require experimental confirmation during the development process. The experimental facility described here has been constructed to support the development of the fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor concept. The facility is capable of operating at up to 700°C and incorporates a centrifugal pump to circulate FLiNaK salt through a removable test section. A unique inductive heating technique is used to apply heat to the test section, allowing heat transfer testing to be performed. An air-cooled heat exchanger removes added heat. Supporting loop infrastructure includes a pressure control system, a trace heating system, and a complement of instrumentation to measure salt flow, temperatures, and pressures around the loop. The initial experiment is aimed at measuring fluoride-salt heat transfer inside a heated pebble bed similar to that used for the core of the pebble-bed advanced high-temperature reactor. This paper describes the details of the loop design, auxiliary systems used to support the facility, inductive heating system, and facility capabilities.},

A self-made program with specially selected heat transfer correlations is developed to design the heat exchanger. After that, experiments are conducted to verify the design and characterize the heat transfer behavior of the heat exchanger. Results show that the measured key parameters of the heat exchanger correspond well to the values from the self-made program. Further experimental studies on the thermal performances indicate that empirical correlations in the self-made program could adequately describe the heat transfer characteristics of the heat exchanger. Based on above studies, it is concluded that the self-made program can be well used for the thermal sizing design of molten salt-to-air heat exchanger.},

abstract = {AbstractThe molten fluoride salt eutectic LiF-NaF-KF (FLiNaK) has been proposed as a coolant for use in Generation IV reactors designed to operate at temperatures at which radiation heat transfer (RHT) may be significant. Little research has been performed into the absorption coefficient of FLiNaK as it pertains to thermal RHT. An estimate of the spectral absorption coefficient for FLiNaK has been generated using informed assumptions and existing data for the constituent salts. The effect of heat transfer, as it pertains to flowing salt in circular cross-section pipes with heated walls, has been investigated for laminar flow using a mathematical model. The combined energy equation, in various geometries, was solved for laminar flow, with the radiative heat flux calculated using the differential approximation. The percentage of energy transferred by radiation to the salt was found to be primarily a function of pipe diameter, wall temperature, and the salt absorption coefficient. A map of temperatures and pipe diameters has been generated, which indicates where RHT is significant. A correlation has been proposed, based on the mathematical model, to account for increase in Nusselt number due to radiation. Additional discussion is included on the effects of wall emissivity and high Reynolds flows.},
